debug javascript with dev tools

-content scripts listing lots of functions that shouldnt be going off could be chrome extensions
rather than your actual code
- get around this by utilising incognito mode


breakpoints-
pause code at any point while being executed- investigate values

BLUE ARROW ON CODE LINE
- typically where you think code is breaking
- create by clicking numbers, then refresh will stop at first breakpoint chosen



execution control buttons-
help control the pace when going through code
- first button is not play and pause it is continuation to next breakpoint
- do not create loads of breakpoints just step over function key which is second control btn
- step into= if you want to dive into function
- step out= does opposite, takes you out to parent scope
- watch= lets you keep an eye on any js expression in real time with app


the call stack- 
when paused, will show what function pad brought you to that breakpoint
async checkbox= include asynchronus calls like for jquery
